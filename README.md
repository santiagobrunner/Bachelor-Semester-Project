# Scintillating Fiber Detector Analysis ‚Äì Bachelor Semester Project


## üìå Overview

This repository contains the data analysis and modeling code developed for my Bachelor‚Äôs thesis:

**‚ÄúDesign and Characterization of Plastic Scintillating Detectors for Next-Generation Neutrino Experiments‚Äù**  


The project involved evaluating the light transmission efficiency of different optical resins applied to scintillating fibers used in particle detection, with a focus on experimental reproducibility and photon loss modeling.

##  Project Goals

- Quantify the impact of resin refractive index on photon propagation through scintillating fibers.
- Analyze photon count histograms from silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs).
- Fit Gaussian and double exponential models to determine gain and attenuation length.
- Identify the optimal resin for use in neutrino detector upgrades (e.g., ND280 in the T2K experiment).

##  Key Features

-  **Statistical data analysis** using Python and ROOT
-  **Signal processing** from photodetector readings
-  **Model fitting** (Gaussian and exponential) to extract meaningful physics parameters
-  **Experimental design and error modeling**
-  **Visualizations** of photon counts vs. distance and refractive index

## Technologies Used

- `Python` (NumPy, matplotlib)
- `ROOT` (CERN) for histogram processing
- 3D printing & mechanical setup for reproducible experiments
- SiPM readout via CAEN hardware + Janus DAQ software
